# Real-Time Trading with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements an automated real-time trading system that leverages a machine learning model to make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on real-time market data. The model is deployed as a REST API, which is integrated into a trading pipeline that continuously processes live data, makes predictions, and executes trades through a broker's API.

### Key Components:
- **Model Deployment**: The trained machine learning model is deployed as a REST API using Docker and Flask.
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Market data is collected through financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage) or broker WebSockets for live feeds.
- **Prediction**: The data is fed into the model to generate predictions in real-time.
- **Automated Trading**: Based on model predictions, trades are executed automatically using a broker’s API (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers).

## Features
- Real-time data collection from financial markets or brokers via API/WebSockets.
- REST API for serving model predictions.
- Integration with a broker's API for automatic trade execution.
- Scalable deployment via Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services (AWS, Azure).
- Backtesting and paper trading for model evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.x
- Alpha Vantage API or any other financial data provider (API key required)
- Broker API access (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)
- Basic knowledge of financial markets and machine learning models

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/christine33-creator/stock-market-forecast.git
cd stock-market-forecast
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to store your API keys and credentials:
```bash
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
BROKER_API_KEY=your_broker_api_key
BROKER_SECRET_KEY=your_broker_secret_key
```

### 5. Build and Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker build -t trading-ml-model .
docker run -p 5000:5000 trading-ml-model
```

## Usage (WIP)

### 1. Start the Real-Time Data Collection
You can collect real-time data using financial APIs or WebSockets. Here's an example using Alpha Vantage:
```bash
python collect_data.py
```

### 2. Preprocess and Predict
The system preprocesses the real-time data and sends a request to the deployed model API for predictions:
```bash
python predict.py
```
This script will:
- Preprocess the raw market data.
- Call the deployed machine learning model's API to get predictions.
- Print or log the prediction results.

### 3. Automated Trading
Based on the model predictions, trades are placed automatically through the broker’s API:
```bash
python trade.py
```
The `trade.py` script will:
- Continuously monitor the predictions.
- Execute buy/sell orders through the broker’s API based on trading logic.

### 4. Example API Call for Prediction
To make a prediction via the deployed model:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [your_feature_data]}'
```

## Configuration

### `config.json`
Modify the `config.json` file to customize the trading strategy, thresholds, and risk management:
```json
{
  "buy_threshold": 0.8,
  "sell_threshold": 0.2,
  "trade_amount": 100,
  "stop_loss": 0.05
}
```

### API Keys
Make sure to provide your API keys in the `.env` file for both data collection and broker access.
